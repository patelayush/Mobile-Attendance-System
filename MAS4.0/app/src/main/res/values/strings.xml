    <string name="about">The mobile attendance system has been built to eliminate the time and effort wasted in taking attendances in schools and colleges.
        It also greatly reduces the amount of paper resources needed in attendance data management.
        This is an android mobile app. Itâ€™s built to be used for school/college faculty so that they may take student attendance on their phones.
        \n\nThe system is divided into following modules:
        \n\nStudent Attendance List Creation: Once this App is installed on a phone,  it allows user to create a student attendance sheet consisting of name, roll number, total present,total classes,percentage attendance.
        He has to fill student names along with associated roll numbers. \n
        Attendance Marking: The faculty has the list on his phone now. He may see the list call roll numbers and mark checkbox on the basis of absence/presence of student.
        \n\nAttendance Storage: This data is now stored in the faculty mobile phone. Faculty may also view it anytime on their phone.
        \n\nAttendance sheet transfer: The faculty can transfer the file to a server (normal computer) via a bluetooth connection where this data can be stored and maintained by the school or college. \n
        \nThus this system automates attendance system and eliminates the use of paperwork needed for attendance marking and monitoring student attendance.
